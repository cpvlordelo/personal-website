---------------------------
Hi, I am a researcher at Doremir Music Research AB and a PhD student in Computer Science at the Centre For Digital Music (C4DM) at the Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). I currently hold a Marie Sklodowska Curie scholarship and am part of the MIP-Frontiers project, where I am responsible for the QMUL2 research project. Previously, I received a MSc degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (UFRJ and BSc was in electronic engineering from the same university. In 2013.02 and 2014.01 I also spent two semesters at University of California Berkeley as a master-level exchange student.

In particular, my main research interest is on the topic of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) using digital signal processing and machine (deep) learning techniques. More specifically, I got experience with music source separation, automatic music transcription and instrument recognition.
