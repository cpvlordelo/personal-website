---------------------------
Hi, I am a researcher at _Doremir Music Research AB_ and a PhD student in Computer Science at the _Centre For Digital Music (C4DM)_ at the _Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)_. I currently hold a Marie Sklodowska Curie scholarship and am part of the [MIP-Frontiers](www.mipfrontiers.eu) project, where I am the student responsible for the __QMUL2__ research project. Previously, I received a MSc degree in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of _Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (UFRJ)_ and BSc was in Electronic and Computer Engineering from the same university. In 2013.02 and 2014.01 I also spent two semesters at _University of California, Berkeley_ as a master-level exchange student.

In particular, my main research interest is on the topic of __Music Information Retrieval (MIR)__ using digital signal processing and machine (deep) learning techniques. More specifically, I got experience with music source separation, audio fingerprinting, automatic music transcription and instrument recognition.
